# outlier-detection-and-removal-using-percentile
using autoviz to help suggest cleaning suggestions 
after getting cleaning suggestion then you can use percentiles to detect the outliers
check for the max_thresold in your column in our case it is median_income
check also for min_thresold in your column in this case median_icome 
you can now remove the outliers from your data by getting data that lies between the minimum and maximum thresold.
do the same for all the rows with outlier problem.
